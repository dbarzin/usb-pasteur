# Detection engines and verdict policy

This document describes the phase 1 scanning pipeline: each detection engine,
its data files and how to obtain them for development, and how verdicts are
decided.

> [!WARNING]
> Signature downloads described here are for **development only**: these
> files are not signed. A kiosk only uses a signed signature set, verified at
> each start and installed from a signature update device: see
> [signatures.md](signatures.md).

## Pipeline

For each inserted device:

1. **Inventory** (kiosk process, metadata only): the mount point is walked
   with `os.scandir`/`lstat`. Links are never followed, the walk never leaves
   the device, and FIFOs, sockets and device files are listed as skipped.
   The limits apply here (see [Limits](#limits)).
2. **Scan** (worker processes, one file at a time per worker):
   1. open the file read-only, component by component with `O_NOFOLLOW`, and
      check that it is the regular file the inventory recorded;
   2. compute SHA-256, SHA-1 and MD5 in a single streaming read;
   3. identify the type with libmagic (MIME type and description);
   4. run the **hash engines** (MalwareBazaar, then Hashlookup);
   5. run the **content engines** (ClamAV, YARA-X), unless the file is a
      known file and no hash engine reports it (see [Hashlookup](#hashlookup-circl));
   6. aggregate the engine results into the file verdict.
3. **Device verdict**, cleaning, and the **JSON scan report**.

Engines receive a `FileInfo` (relative path, size, hashes, MIME type,
description and a read-only file descriptor). They never reopen the file by
path and keep no state between files.

## Engines

Every engine is enabled by default. If an enabled engine cannot load its data,
the kiosk refuses to start (`usb-pasteur --check-config` shows why). At least
one content engine (ClamAV or YARA-X) is required: hash lookups alone only
recognize files that are already known.

For development, `usb-pasteur-signatures publish dev-signatures --sources
yara-forge,malwarebazaar,hashlookup` downloads the YARA rules, the
MalwareBazaar list and the Hashlookup filter into `./dev-signatures/`, checks
them, and prints the matching configuration (an unsigned set: see
[signatures.md](signatures.md)).

### MalwareBazaar

Offline list of SHA-256 hashes of known malware, from
[abuse.ch MalwareBazaar](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/). A match is **malicious**
(detection `MalwareBazaar.KnownMalware`).

- **Input**: the full SHA-256 export. Downloading it requires a free abuse.ch
  Auth-Key ([auth.abuse.ch](https://auth.abuse.ch/)), sent in the `Auth-Key`
  HTTP header, from `https://bazaar.abuse.ch/export/txt/sha256/full/`. The
  export is a zip archive holding `full_sha256.txt`: a `#` comment header,
  then one lower case hexadecimal SHA-256 per line. The converter accepts the
  zip archive or the text file. Any other line is an error: a malformed export
  is never partially loaded. In October 2026, the export held 1.1 million
  hashes, a 37 MB database.
- **Conversion**:
  `python -m usb_pasteur.hashdb build full_sha256.zip malwarebazaar.sha256.bin`
  (`python -m usb_pasteur.hashdb info <database>` describes a database).
- **Format** (`usb_pasteur/hashdb.py`): a 64-byte header (magic, version,
  count, creation time, SHA-256 of the source export) followed by the sorted
  32-byte digests. The file is memory-mapped and searched by bisection: one
  million hashes take 32 MB, shared by the workers through the page cache.
- **Configuration**: `[engines.malwarebazaar] database`.

### Hashlookup (CIRCL)

The [CIRCL hashlookup](https://www.circl.lu/services/hashlookup/) Bloom
filter of known files (NSRL, Linux distributions, software repositories).

- **Data**: `https://cra.circl.lu/hashlookup/hashlookup-full.bloom` (about
  1 GB and 418 million hashes in October 2026, updated monthly). It holds the **SHA-1** of every known file, in
  upper case hexadecimal, in the DCSO bloom format.
- **Format**: the format of the DCSO `bloom` Go tool and of the `flor` Python
  library. `flor` loads the whole bit array in memory (1 GB per worker), so
  USB-Pasteur has its own memory-mapped reader (`usb_pasteur/bloom.py`). The
  tests check that it agrees with `flor`. Against the real CIRCL filter, it
  agrees with `flor`, finds most Debian system binaries, and answers "known"
  for about 1 in 10,000 random hashes, as expected.
- **Known is not benign**: the sources of hashlookup also contain offensive
  and dual-use tools. A Hashlookup hit is reported as the fact `known = true`
  with the verdict `clean` (no detection), never as a proof of safety.
- **False positives**: a Bloom filter answers "known" for some unknown files.
  The CIRCL filter is built for a probability of 1 in 10,000. The probability
  is recorded with each answer (`fp_rate`) in the scan report.
- **Content engines on known files**: by default, ClamAV and YARA-X scan
  every file, known or not. The CIRCL filter lists the files it has seen,
  among them the EICAR test file, offensive tools and malware samples: a
  kiosk that skipped them reported EICAR clean.
  `[engines.hashlookup] skip_content_engines = true` skips the content
  engines on known files, which saves time on devices full of common
  software, at that cost. The hash engines always run, and **a MalwareBazaar
  match always wins**: content engines still run on a known file that a hash
  engine reports. The skipped engines appear in the report with the reason
  `known file (hashlookup)`, so the decision is auditable.

### ClamAV

[ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net/) through the `clamd` daemon, with a small
built-in client for its Unix socket protocol (`usb_pasteur/clamd.py`):
`zPING`, `zVERSION`, `zFILDES` and `zINSTREAM`.

- **Modes** (`[engines.clamav] mode`): `fildes` passes the open file
  descriptor to clamd, which therefore does not need to read the mount point;
  `instream` sends the content; `auto` (default) uses `fildes`, and
  `instream` only when clamd reports an error with the descriptor.
- **Verdicts**: a detection is malicious, or suspicious when its name matches
  `suspicious_names` (default `PUA.*`, `Heuristics.*`). Names matching
  `error_names` (default `Heuristics.Limits.Exceeded.*`) mean that the file
  was not fully scanned: they are errors. INSTREAM size limit errors,
  timeouts and unexpected replies are errors too.
- **Versions**: the engine version, the database version and its date come
  from `VERSION`, asked again for each scan report (clamd reloads its
  databases while running).

Required `clamd.conf` settings:

```
LocalSocket /run/clamav/clamd.ctl
# Without it, content beyond the limits below is reported as clean
# without being scanned
AlertExceedsMax yes
# At least engines.clamav.max_file_size (100 MiB by default)
MaxFileSize 100M
MaxScanSize 400M
StreamMaxLength 100M
```

The kiosk image also sets:

- `AlertEncrypted yes`: an encrypted archive or document cannot be scanned;
  ClamAV reports it (`Heuristics.Encrypted.Zip`, `.RAR`, `.PDF`...) and the
  kiosk counts it as not fully scanned (`error_names`): the device is not
  verified, the file is not removed;
- `AlertOLE2Macros yes`: an Office document with macros (VBA, also inside
  `.docm` or `.xlsm`) is suspicious (`Heuristics.OLE2.ContainsMacros`): with
  `scan.suspicious = "block"`, it is quarantined and removed like a
  malicious file; `"warn"` only reports it.

Archives (zip, rar, 7z, tar, cab...) are unpacked and scanned by ClamAV
itself, within its limits (`MaxScanSize`, `MaxFileSize`, `MaxRecursion`,
`MaxFiles`): beyond them, a decompression bomb for instance, the file is not
fully scanned (`AlertExceedsMax`).

`ScanImageFuzzyHash no`: ClamAV would decode every
image, also those inside a PDF or an Office document, to compare a fuzzy hash
with a few signatures of known images. It took half the scan time of a
29 MB PDF of images (41 s, then 19 s); the images are still scanned.

Files bigger than `[engines.clamav] max_file_size` are errors without being
sent: keep it equal to the clamd limits.

**Development setup** (Debian or Ubuntu):

```sh
sudo apt install clamav-daemon clamav-freshclam
sudo systemctl stop clamav-freshclam && sudo freshclam && sudo systemctl start clamav-freshclam
# edit /etc/clamav/clamd.conf as above, then
sudo systemctl restart clamav-daemon
```

**Third-party signatures** (for example [Sanesecurity](https://sanesecurity.com/usage/linux-scripts/))
only need to be loadable by clamd: put the database files (`.ndb`, `.hdb`,
`.ldb`...) in the clamd `DatabaseDirectory` (`/var/lib/clamav`) and reload
clamd (`clamdscan --reload`). The upstream `clamav-unofficial-sigs` script
automates this (the Debian package exists up to Debian 12 only). Some
third-party signatures are prone to false positives: list their names in
`suspicious_names` to report them as suspicious instead of malicious.

### YARA-X

[YARA-X](https://virustotal.github.io/yara-x/) through its official Python
bindings, with the [YARA Forge](https://yarahq.github.io/) and
[signature-base](https://github.com/Neo23x0/signature-base) rules.

- **Rule sets** (`[engines.yara] rules`): a list of `{ name, path }`, where
  path is a `.yar` file or a folder of `.yar`/`.yara` files. Each file gets its
  own namespace, so identical rule names never conflict.
- **YARA Forge already includes signature-base**: by default only the YARA
  Forge `core` package is configured. Add the full signature-base set only if
  you need the rules YARA Forge leaves out.
- **Compilation**: once at startup. The compiled rules are cached in
  `cache_dir`, keyed by the YARA-X version, the options and the content of
  every rule file. The cache holds native code: it must be as trusted as the
  rules themselves (folder `0700`, owned by the kiosk).
- **Compile errors** are never silently dropped. `on_compile_error = "fail"`
  (default) refuses to start and lists every error;
  `"skip_rule"` drops the invalid rules, logs them and lists them in every
  scan report (`engines[].extra.excluded_rules`). `exclude` ignores rule
  files by glob pattern. With YARA-X 1.21, YARA Forge core (5,110 rules) and
  signature-base (5,904 rules) compile without error.
- **External variables** used by the signature-base rules, filled for each
  file:

  | Variable | Value |
  |---|---|
  | `filename` | file name |
  | `filepath` | full path on the device, starting with `/` |
  | `extension` | extension in lower case, with the dot (`.exe`) |
  | `filetype` | THOR-like type mapped from the libmagic MIME type (`EXE`, `ELF`, `ZIP`, `PDF`...), empty when unknown: an approximation of THOR |
  | `owner` | always empty: removable filesystems have no meaningful owner |

- **Verdict mapping**, from the `score` metadata of each matching rule
  (0-100, used by YARA Forge and signature-base):

  | Score | Verdict |
  |---|---|
  | `>= malicious_score` (75) | malicious |
  | `>= suspicious_score` (40) | suspicious |
  | below | informational: recorded in the report (`facts.informational`), no effect on the verdict |
  | no score | `default_score` (60): suspicious |

- **Timeout**: the native YARA-X timeout (`timeout`, seconds); a timeout is an
  error.
- YARA-X compiles rules to native code at run time (wasmtime): it does not
  work under systemd `MemoryDenyWriteExecute=yes`.

YARA does not unpack archives: EICAR inside a zip is detected by ClamAV, not
by YARA.

### File type (libmagic)

`python-magic` (Debian package `python3-magic`) identifies the MIME type and
description from the first MiB of each file, given as a buffer: libmagic does
not access the filesystem and does not decompress. The type is recorded in
the report, used for the YARA `filetype` variable and by the heuristics.

### Heuristics

The structure of the files, without signatures
(`src/usb_pasteur/engines/heuristics.py`, `[engines.heuristics]`); findings
are suspicious, never malicious:

- **PDF with active content** (like pdfid): JavaScript (`/JavaScript`, `/JS`)
  or a Launch action (`Heuristics.PDF.JavaScript`, `Heuristics.PDF.Launch`).
  Names hidden with escapes (`/J#61vaScript`) are decoded. Automatic actions,
  embedded files and forms (`/OpenAction`, `/AA`, `/EmbeddedFile`,
  `/RichMedia`, `/XFA`, `/AcroForm`) are counted as facts of the report.
  Names inside compressed object streams are not seen: ClamAV and YARA look
  there.
- **Disguised program**: a program (PE, ELF, Mach-O, MSI, from libmagic)
  whose extension claims something else (`facture.pdf`:
  `Heuristics.Executable.Disguised`), or a document extension followed by
  one that Windows runs (`facture.pdf.exe`, `rapport.docx.js`:
  `Heuristics.DoubleExtension`).

The heuristics alone detect no malware: ClamAV or YARA-X stays required.

### Fake engine

`kiosk.fake_scan = true` replaces every engine with the fake engine, for
development only: it reports the EICAR test file as malicious and everything
else as clean.

## Verdict policy

### File verdict

| Engine results | File verdict |
|---|---|
| at least `policy.min_malicious_engines` engines report malicious (default: one) | malicious |
| otherwise, any malicious or suspicious result | suspicious |
| otherwise, any engine error or timeout, a content engine without result, or content engines skipped for another reason than a known file | error |
| otherwise | clean |

A file is never clean unless every enabled content engine scanned it, or
skipped it because it is a known file.

### Device verdict

The worst file verdict: **malicious**, then **suspicious**, then **not
verified** (a file could not be fully scanned, or the walk stopped at a limit),
then **clean**. The kiosk then applies:

| Setting | `block` (default) | `warn` |
|---|---|---|
| `scan.suspicious` | suspicious files are quarantined and removed like malicious ones | they are kept and listed as a warning |
| `scan.on_error` | the device is reported as **NOT VERIFIED: do not use it** | the user is warned |

Files that could not be scanned are listed but **never removed**: they are not
known to be malicious.

### Limits

| Setting | Default | Beyond it |
|---|---|---|
| `limits.max_file_size` | 1 GiB | the file is skipped, the device is not verified |
| `limits.max_files` | 100,000 | files and folders; the walk stops, the device is not verified |
| `limits.max_depth` | 64 | deeper folders are skipped, the device is not verified |

### Timeouts

Each worker process scans one file at a time. The kiosk process supervises
them with two deadlines:

- the **engine deadline**: the timeout of the running engine plus 5 seconds;
  engines with a native timeout (YARA-X, the clamd socket) report it first;
- the **file deadline**: `scan.file_timeout` for the whole file.

When a deadline expires, the worker is killed and replaced, and the file is an
error naming the engine. A crashed worker is handled the same way. A clean
answer that arrives after the engine timeout is an error too.

## Signature freshness

At startup, the kiosk warns (logs and screen) when a signature database is
older than `signatures.max_age_days` (7 days), or the `max_age_days` of its
engine (45 days for Hashlookup, published monthly). The date comes from the
`manifest.json` of the signature folder when present
(`{"<file>": {"version", "date", "source", "sha256"}}`), otherwise from the
file modification time; ClamAV reports its own database date. A database
without a date is only logged (`signatures_undated`), not shown: a ClamAV
database of custom signatures only has none (the date comes from the header
of the official `daily` database).

## Scan report

Every scan writes a JSON report in `report.folder`, described by
[`src/usb_pasteur/schemas/scan-report-v1.schema.json`](../src/usb_pasteur/schemas/scan-report-v1.schema.json):
device, configuration, engines and signature versions, every file with its
hashes, type, verdict and per-engine results, the device verdict and the
actions taken. The quarantine manifest references it.
