"""Verdict aggregation: per file, then per device. Fail closed by default.

File verdict, from the results of its engines:

1. malicious if at least policy.min_malicious_engines engines report it as
   malicious (default: one is enough);
2. otherwise suspicious if an engine reports it as malicious or suspicious;
3. otherwise error if an engine failed, or if a content engine gave no
   result, or if every content engine skipped it for a reason other than a
   known file (hashlookup);
4. otherwise clean.

A file is never clean without at least one content engine result, unless it
is a known file and the content engines were skipped on purpose.

Device verdict: the worst file verdict (malicious, then suspicious, then not
verified when a file or the device was not fully scanned, then clean). The
kiosk applies scan.suspicious and scan.on_error to it.
