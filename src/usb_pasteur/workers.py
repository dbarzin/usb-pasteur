"""Scan worker processes, one engine each, supervised by a watchdog.

Each worker is a long-lived process (usb_pasteur.worker) that loads one
engine once, then scans files one at a time: a compromised engine (a crafted
file exploiting YARA-X, libmagic...) cannot forge the result of another
engine, and a crash only affects that engine for the file being scanned.
With scan.sandbox, workers run in a bubblewrap sandbox under a dedicated
user (usb_pasteur.sandbox).

For each file, the kiosk (this module, in the kiosk process):

1. opens it (usb_pasteur.inventory.open_entry) and hashes it itself: the hash
   engines and the scan report get hashes no worker can forge;
2. asks the worker of each hash engine (MalwareBazaar, Hashlookup), with the
   hashes only: these workers never get the file;
3. unless the file is known and content engines are skipped for known files,
   passes its descriptor to a worker of each content engine (ClamAV, YARA),
   which never opens a file of the device;
4. combines the results itself (usb_pasteur.policy). A worker only reports
   the result of its own engine, as validated JSON (usb_pasteur.protocol); a
   malformed answer is handled like a crash.

Hash engines have one worker each, content engines scan.workers each: up to
scan.workers files are scanned at the same time.

concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor is not used: it cannot cancel a running
task, and a killed worker breaks the whole pool. Here, the supervisor arms two
deadlines for each engine of a file:

- the engine deadline: the timeout of the engine plus a grace delay;
- the file deadline: scan.file_timeout, for the whole file.

When a deadline expires the worker is killed (SIGKILL), the engine result is
an error and a new worker is started. A worker that dies (crash, out of
memory) is handled the same way. A timeout or a crash is never clean.
